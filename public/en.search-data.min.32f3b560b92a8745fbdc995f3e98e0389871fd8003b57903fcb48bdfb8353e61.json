Then it is always possible to place 1 or 2 cows to claim everything in an interval. Find for each interval, the maximum 1 cow and 2 cow patch scores. Add 2 cow score increase over 1 cow to list, along with 1 cows. Then each value in the array represents using one cow. Simply sort and take first n.\nAlice and Apples\r#\rSort into gaining and losing apples. Sort gaining by increasing $a$, and losing by decreasing $b$. We prove optimality with an exchange argument for two apples.\nElves and Reindeer\r#\rHard.

Then if we have to range unite, just skip to next unmerged.\nRemove the Ends\r#\rTake prefix and suffix sums of positive and negative, because we will always take some prefix of positive from the left and some suffix of negative from the right (wipes it out kinda like swipe) so linear check for maximum.\nTwo Colors\r#\rLoop over k, where the fence is painted 1 to k, k+1 to n. Subtract double counted colors that are sufficient to paint both ends.\nGood Triplets\r#\rFor each point, let c be the number of points that are on the next \u0026ldquo;half\u0026rdquo; of the circle. Then any triangle formed from these points will not include the origin. We can sum cases for 1/2/3 points from the current spot. These cases are independent and will not overcount as other starting points cannot possible include three points that are all not starting from that spot. However, we do doublecount the diameters, so if the circumference is even then we need to add back half the subtracted degenerate diameters.\nPick It\r#\rRange dp, state is max score from l to r, for each balloon in l to r we take it as the last one to be popped. so then we can combine left and right for proper transition.\nBalanced Trees\r#\rMath/skipping trick - write floor as an inequality statement, then rearrange to get range of i such that the subtrees are of weight v. The inequality also says i \u0026lt;= w//v, so the next i that changes the subtree weight should be w // v + 1.\nConvex Hull\r#\r2D dijkstras, for each island keep minimum time, as well as minimum hull wear for that time\nIvana\r#\rCircle = array * 2 + interval recursive dp, not too hard\nDaily Commute\r#\rYou always take the train for some prefix of your journey.\nSwapping Seats\r#\rAnother circle = array * 2, check every possible start point for section A, and realize that sorting A and B means C is done.\nPalindromic Poster\r#\r%.\nMatching Problem\r#\rSwipe\r#\rFor each block of values in the target, get the source of the swipe.\nKoala Balloons\r#\rUse PSA to check if blocked, as well as binary searching on maximum number of balloons.\nFlowers DPQ\r#\rBIT to optimize transition to logn with 1. get maximum from 0 to h and 2. update maximum of height h (propogates to all higher heights)\nAn FFT Problem\r#\rDP in order of values to avoid overcounting, and process subset products backwards to avoid overwriting dp values.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/ap/calc/","title":"Notes","section":"AP Notes","content":"\rUnit 1: Limits and Continuity\r#\rThe limit $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(a)$ exists if the limit from the left is the same as the limit from the right.\nIf the left and right limits approach the same thing, it could be unbounded (tends to $\\pm\\infty$).\nIf the left and right limits do not approach the same thing, then the limit does not exist.\nA function is continuous at $a \\iff \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$.\nLimit Properties\r#\r$$\\lim_{x \\to p} (f(x) + g(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to p} f(x) + \\lim_{x \\to p} g(x)$$$$\\lim_{x \\to p} (f(x) - g(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to p} f(x) - \\lim_{x \\to p} g(x)$$$$\\lim_{x \\to p} (f(x) \\cdot g(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to p} f(x) \\cdot \\lim_{x \\to p} g(x)$$$$\\lim_{x \\to p} \\left(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right) = \\frac{\\lim_{x \\to p} f(x)}{\\lim_{x \\to p} g(x)}$$\rDiscontinuities\r#\rPoint/removable discontinuity Jump discontinuity Asymptotic discontinuity Continuity over an interval\r#\rFunction f is continuous over $(a, b)$ if and only if $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c)$ for all $a \u003c x \u003c b$.
