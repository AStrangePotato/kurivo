<p>K.D. Leka and colleagues found that the Sun’s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares—intense eruptions of electromagnetic radiation that emanate from active regions in the Sun’s photosphere and can interfere with telecommunications on Earth. Preceding a flare, the corona temporarily exhibits increased brightness above the region where the flare is ______blank.</p>
<p>or phrase?</p>
<p>A.
antecedent</p>
<p>B.
impending</p>
<p>C.
innocuous</p>
<p>D.

<p>While recent scholarship has undermined claims that the works of twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd were ______blank other Muslim philosophers of his time, it is indisputable that his location in the Muslim-ruled area of what is now Spain meant that his works were primarily available thousands of miles west of the era’s center of Islamic thought.</p>
<p>A.
controversial among</p>

<p>The following text is from Thomas Mann’s 1924 novel The Magic Mountain, translated by John E. Woods in 1995.</p>
<p>The story of Hans Castorp that we intend to tell here—not for his sake (for the reader will come to know him as a perfectly ordinary, if engaging young man), but for the sake of the story itself, which seems to us to be very much worth telling (although in Hans Castorp’s favor it should be noted that it is his story, and that not every story happens to everybody)—is a story that took place long ago, and is, so to speak, covered with the patina of history and must necessarily be told with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past.</p>
<p>What does the text most strongly suggest about the story of Hans Castorp?</p>
<p>A.
Though it is true that stories of even the most uninteresting people are themselves interesting because all people are unique, the reason this story is interesting is nonetheless difficult to understand because of the passage of time.</p>
<p>B.
Even though it is a story of a person of no particular importance, its age and the manner in which it therefore must be told are both indicators that the story itself is important.</p>
<p>C.
Like all stories about the lives of inconsequential people, this story must necessarily be related in a particular way if the reason the story is consequential is to be made evident to the audience.</p>
<p>D.
It is a remarkable story that happened to an unremarkable person, though one could plausibly argue that because the story is valuable, some of its value accrues to the person at its center.</p>
<p>You selected answer B. The correct answer is D.</p>
