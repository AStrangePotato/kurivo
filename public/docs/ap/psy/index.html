reaction formation - psychoanalytic defense mechanism by which the ego unconsciously switches unacceptable impulses into their opposites, Thus, people may express feelings that are opposite of their anxiety-arousing unconscious feelings.
Projection - psychoanalytic defense mechanism by which people disguise their own threatening impulses by attributing them to others.
Rationalization - psychoanalytic defense mechanism that offers self-justifying explanations in place of the real, more threatening, unconscious reasons for one&rsquo;s actions.
Displacement - psychoanalytic defense mechanism that shifts sexual or aggressive impulses toward a more acceptable or less threatening object of person, as when redirecting anger toward a safer outlet.

Denial - psychoanalytic defense mechanism by which people refuse to believe or even to perceive painful realities.</p>
